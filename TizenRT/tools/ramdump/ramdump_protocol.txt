RAMDUMP PROTOCOL :
-----------------

HOST  ------------> TARGET
HOST  <-----------  TARGET

1.  TARGET will be waiting for Handshake string from HOST application.
2.  HOST will send handshake string to TARGET.
3.  TARGET will receive handshake string.
4.  TARGET will check if the handshake string is the expected one,
	if success, TARGET will send character 'A' as acknowledge.
	if failure, TARGET will send character 'N' as negative acknowlede.
5.  TARGET will send 1 byte holding number of memory regions.
6.  HOST will receive1 byte holding number of memory regions.
7.  TARGET will send 4 bytes holding RAMDUMP start address for all memory regions.
8.  HOST will receive 4 bytes RAMDUMP start address for all memory regions.
9.  TARGET will send 4 bytes holding RAMDUMP size for all memory regions.
10. HOST will receive 4 bytes RAMDUMP size for all memory regions.
11. TARGET will send 1 byte holding heap index for all memory regions.
12. HOST will receive 1 byte holding heap index for all memory regions.
13. HOST will send 1 byte holding number of memory regions to be dumped by target.
14. TARGET will receive 1 byte holding number of memory regions to be dumped.
15. TARGET will send RAMDUMP size bytes in a loop for each memory region to be dumped.
16. HOST will receive RAMDUMP size bytes in a loop untill all "size" bytes received for each memory region to be dumped.

Note :
Handshake string is "RAMDUMP".
